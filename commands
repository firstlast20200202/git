download code:
git clone [url]

version control my own code:
1. create a folder myProject locally and get into the folder in terminal
2. git init  //initialise an empty git repo in /myProject/.git/
3. in myProject folder create a file of your code, say, main.py, then save
4. upload your code: git add .  //this . includes all the files and non-empty folders in the current folder myProject
5. git commit -m "XXX"  //upload your code
6. git log   //verify
